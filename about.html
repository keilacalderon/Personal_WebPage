		Keila came to USCB to purse her dream of becoming a programmer.
		 After previously providing maintance 
		 to the Disney websites and mobile apps at Accenture she realized
		 what it was she wanted to study and enrolled in the University's
		  Computational Science program. </p></br>
		 
		<p>As she developed her skills, her passion for programming and 
		development began to grown. Though she was faily new to 
		the STEM field, the subject matter gradually grew on her.
		The realization of creating things from catch as a programmer fascinated her. 
		She loved having the ability to answer her own questions and solving 
		her own problems. </p></br>
		<p>Keila had gained a new set of tools which shaped her world.</p></br>
</div>​

<div class="content1"><p>By the end of her first year, there was no question what her career would be.
		 The experience from her school projects, which range from creating a video game, 
		a database, websites for non-profits, and leading her school's ACM club have become pivotal experiences to her
		 development. </p> </br>
		<p>What will Keila do with a degree in computational science? "I'm not sure" she says,
		"but that's the beauty about this major- the possibilities are endless. 
		 The world relies on technology and software, and having these skills will hopefully
		  to open doors for me, whatever doors those might be." </p></div>​
